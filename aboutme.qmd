Hi! My name is Kai Suzuki and I am a third-year Environmental Studies (B.S) student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I have had my mind set on studying the environment, and more broadly conservation goals, since a young age. I spent two years at Orange Coast College, where I received my Associates of Science (A.S.) degree. My environment growing up is something I cherish and is a deep inspiration to my academic goals. 

At UCSB, I have contributed to local restoration efforts at the Storke Ranch Open Space and the North Campus Open Space. At Storke Ranch, I had the chance to work with *Lasthenia glabrata ssp. coulteri*, an endangered native vernal pool plant. 

I will also start a position as a Worm Wrangler at the UCSB Department of Public Worms in Summer 2025, where I am excited to help make the campus a more sustainable and food-sovereign place. Outside of school and work, you can find me drinking coffee, cooking, gardening, running, and watching baseball (Go Angels!).
