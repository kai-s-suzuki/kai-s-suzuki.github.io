Hi! My name is Kai Suzuki and I am a third-year Environmental Studies (B.S) student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I have had my mind set on studying the environment, and more broadly conservation goals, since a young age. I spent two years at Orange Coast College, where I received my Associates of Science (A.S.) degree. 

At UCSB, I have contributed to local restoration efforts at the Storke Ranch Open Space and the North Campus Open Space. I will also be starting a position at the Department of Public Worms in Summer 2025, where I am excited to help make the campus a more sustainable and food-sovereign place. 

Outside of school and work, you can find me drinking coffee, cooking, gardening, running, and watching baseball.
