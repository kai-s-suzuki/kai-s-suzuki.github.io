# Conservation Plan

For Professor Dawn Murray's Conservation Planning course at UC Santa Barbara, four of my classmates and I constructed a water resiliency plan for a Chumash-owned property in Lompoc, California. 

# Testimony

In this testimony project, my partner and I created and recited a written piece of legislation advocating for co-management of public lands, specifically in Yosemite and Great Smokies National Parks. Professor Deborah Williams, J.D., provided immense support and expertise in the process.
